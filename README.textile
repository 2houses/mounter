h1. LocomotiveCMS Mounter
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/locomotivecms/mounter.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/locomotivecms/mounter)

The "LocomotiveCMS Mounter" is a simple module to store in memory a LocomotiveCMS site whatever the source is:

* a site template built with the editor and on the local filesystem
* a zip file of a site template on the local filesystem
* a zip file of a site template but online through an url
* a LocomotiveCMS engine

It also includes a mechanism which could save the site from the memory to any targets (filesystem, another LocomotiveCMS engine, ...etc).
This saving mechanism has to be implemented in the application using that module.
